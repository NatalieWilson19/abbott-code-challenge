# Abbott's Web Automation Code Challenge - Option 3

This project uses Robot Framework with the Selenium Library to open and login into the LibreView webpage. It uses a python script utilizing IMAP to login to Outlook and fetch a 2 factor verification code.

This project can be run with the command:

robot .\Main.robot
